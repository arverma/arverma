Hey there 👋

I am a motivated and diligent software developer. I have worked on building scalable ETL pipelines, serverless applications to run containerized Python and Spark jobs, and solutions to productionize machine learning codes hassle-free for data scientists. I have worked with cross-functional teams and clients within US markets implementing solutions in the food and marketing industry.

Also, I engage myself in helping the community by writing blogs and organizing workshops. Feel free to connect and start a conversation.
